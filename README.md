Fetitor
=============================================================================

Fetitor is an editor for Mabinogi's features file (features.xml.compiled),
which is essentially a compiled XML file. It converts it to XML and back
on the fly, to allow the user to edit it more quickly than if they had to
convert it first, open and edit it, and convert it back.
